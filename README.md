===============
Guidelines for sculpting your `~/.vimrc`.

Unlike many other so-called "distibutions", "templates" or "awesome `vimrc`", this repository is ***NOT*** meant to be an actual `vimrc` or even form the basis of your own `vimrc` so don't copy it to your `$HOME` and expect it to work.

The purpose of this repository is to document battle-tested best practices regarding Vim configuration. Use it as a reference, not as a starting point.

Furthermore, a `vimrc` is something personal, that grows, shrinks and evolve over time, as your Vim-fu augments and your needs change. While looking at other people's `vimrc` can be an interesting move when looking for a practical solution to an actual problem, one should refrain himself from looking for solutions to non-existing problems.
